- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I realized that inheritance makes it so much easier and faster when making multiple classes with common features. By using the keyword extends and avoiding redundancy, not only did the length of the code get so much shorter, but also it was much easier to understand the program.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Most of the things worked well, except that it was my first time using a hashtable. At first, I used .contains(...) to check if a book with a certain title was in the library collection. However, I found out that .contains is for checking if a certain value is in the hashtable, which is a boolean value in this case. However, because we are entering the title of the book, which is a key, we would have to use the .containsKey method instead to make it easier to see if the book we are looking for is in the collection or not.
